# MultiBot
Multi-use bot for Discord.

This currently requires Python 3.6.x.

Python 3.7+ introduces a new keyword (__*async*__) that causes an error to be thrown.

Current features:
  - D&D/RPG Dice Rolls
  - Channel Management, including:
    - Move all users from one voice channel to another
  - Super low effort memes

  - Unzip the file.
  - Run Setup_Multibot_Windows.bat. (This installs the required Python packages.)
  - Do some other stuff (that I'll update later).
